This is a experimental firmware, designed for esp32c3 boards like the waveshare esp32 c3 mini.
More of a proof of concept/tech demo, but it's already a lot of fun to use.
The scanning could probably be more robust, if the led is orange, it means only one device is connected, some automatic retry would be nice.
Currently you can just reboot if one poi does not connect on the first try.
